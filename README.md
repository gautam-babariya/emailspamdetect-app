# Email Spam Classification

This project is an **Email Spam Classification** system that uses machine learning to categorize emails as **spam** or **not spam**. The goal is to implement a model capable of accurately identifying unwanted emails using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Overview

The Email Spam Classification project involves training a machine learning model to detect spam emails based on the content of the email. The project follows these main steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the email text.
2. Feature Extraction: Converting text into numerical data suitable for training.
3. Model Training: Building a machine learning model to identify spam.
4. Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and model building.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: NLP toolkit for text preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for interactive analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a collection of labeled emails with a target indicating whether each email is spam or not. Common features include:
- **Email Text**: The raw content of the email.
- **Label**: A binary label (1 for spam, 0 for not spam).
- 
## Model

The model is built using **machine learning algorithms**. Common models explored in this project include:
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Random Forest**

After experimentation, the model with the best performance is selected for the final deployment.
